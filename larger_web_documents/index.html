<h2>Blog Post for February 11, 2016.</h2>
  <p>Sheryl Sandberg is one of the coolest women in the world. She is consistently trying to make the business world more equitable
  for women and people of color. And she leads by example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sheryl worked in the White House.</li>
    <li>Then she went to Facebook and became a billionaire.</li>
    <li>Her life hasn't been perfect, though.</li>
    <li>Last year, her husband died suddenly while exercising.</li>
    <li>She is bouncing back, though, and wrote a great book for girls called Lean In.</li>
  </ul>
